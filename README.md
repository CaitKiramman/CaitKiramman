Hi, I’m @CaitKiramman, an IT engineering student who’s passionate about creating applications with GUIs. 
In the future, I’m aiming to dive into game development and create unique, exciting worlds for others to enjoy. 
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me strategizing my next move in a League of Legends match.
And when it comes to deadlines, I always say: 'I’ll have this finished before tea time!'
